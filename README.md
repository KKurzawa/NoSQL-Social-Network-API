# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

Due to social networks requiring speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data an API using MongoDB is a very handy tool.  This API allows users to get/create/delete/update users, user thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and user's friends.  It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, JavaScript, and Node.js.

## Usage

Once you start the database in your command line you are able to manipulate data in the social network database through Insomnia by creating/updating/deleting users, thoughts, and reactions to thoughts in the database.  Users can be added or deleted as friends as well.  If a user is deleted, the users thoughts will be deleted as well.
