# NoSQL: Social Network API

Due to social networks reguiring speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data an API using MongoDB is a very handy tool.  This API allows users to get/create/delete/update users, user thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and user's friends.  It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, JavaScript, and Node.js.
