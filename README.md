# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

Due to social networks requiring speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data an API using MongoDB is a very handy tool.  This API allows users to get/create/delete/update users and user thoughts.  It also allows you to create and delete reactions to thoughts, and user's friends.  It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, JavaScript, and Node.js.

## Usage

Once you start the database in your command line you are able to manipulate data in the social network database with Insomnia by viewing/creating/updating/deleting users and thoughts.  Reactions to thoughts can be added or deleted and viewed by viewing users or thoughts.  Users can be added or deleted as friends and can be viewed by viewing the user that the friend was added to.  If a user is deleted, the user's thoughts will be deleted as well.
